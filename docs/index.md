What are LLM's:
LLM stands for Large Language Model, which refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems that are trained on vast amounts of text data and are able to generate text that mimics human writing. Here are some key things to know about LLMs:
-- LLMs are a type of neural network, which is a computing system loosely modeled on the neural networks in the human brain. 
-- LLMs have an architecture that is optimized for processing language data.
-- They are "large" models because they have billions or trillions of parameters, allowing them to learn complex patterns and relationships within text data. The more data they are trained on, the more capable they become.
-- Popular examples of LLMs include GPT-3, created by OpenAI, and BERT, created by Google. Models designed more recently like GPT-3.5 and Anthropic's Claude also fall into this category.
-- Training involves feeding the model vast amounts of text data like books, websites, and social media posts for it to analyze statistical patterns and generate probabilistic predictions about language.
-- LLMs can generate remarkably human-like text, summarize long passages, translate between languages, answer questions based on context, and more. Their capabilities continue to rapidly improve.
-- Limitations include the potential to perpetuate biases in training data, generate false information, and lack detailed world knowledge. 
-- Research is ongoing to make them more aligned with human values.

In summary, LLMs represent the cutting edge of AI's ability to understand and generate natural 
language at scale, enabling many useful applications. 
Their capabilities will likely continue to grow with advances in computing power and neural network architectures.
